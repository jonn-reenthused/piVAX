# piVAX
A 3D Printable recreation of a DEC Vax 11/780 designed to fit a Raspberry PI. Future updates will add some electronic components

### About the Digital Equipment Corporation VAX
DEC were a giant American computer corporation specialising in mainframe computers. The VAX line followed the PDP line and improved on it's predecessor.  The VAX was capable of running a few operating systems (especially in it's later Alpha guise) but I most knew it for VMS, which I was trained in and had my first couple of jobs in (including a short-term job with DEC themselves in Basingstoke).

I've got some very fond memories of these machines and the VT range of terminals that tended to be connected to them, hence this model.

### What do you need?
You need the following from the models

1 x vax-main-front
1 x vax-main-back
1 x left-panel
1 x right-panel
1 x fascia
1 x pi-carriage
4 x carriage-wheels
4 x LED covers
2 x Switches (made with 1 x Switch-toggle, 1 x Switch-Cradle - you also need a pivot, i've included a printable one, but i'd recommend using metal, maybe the leg of a resistor)
1 x Lock (in future the lock will use the other components - but for now just put the lock in and either glue it or put some tape inside to hold it in place)
1 x key

### Colours
The top should be a lightish blue, I used Amazon Basics Blue (https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07T2R1BQJ)
The Sides, Front, Back and Carriage should all be a beige, or off-white I used Amazon Basics light grey (https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07T6VTG5Q)
The lock (and other lock components including the Key) should be printed in silver, I used Amazon Basics silver (https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07T4X4Y8L)
The fascia should be black
If you have a multimaterial printer (or one very good at fine detail) the digital logo should be done in white for the text and brown for the rectangles
You need 4 LED covers, two red, two green.  The two greens go in the middle.  If you intent to put an LED in there (they fit 3mm LEDs) you need to use translucent filament.
The wheels can be printed in place, with a lot of cleanup.  The wheel itself should be black and the body silver (if you have the ability to print in multicolour)

### What's the future of this model?
I intend to make a video on my YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/@reenthused) which will detail installing SIMH and putting VMS on it.  I'm also hoping to do a future video where I add a control board to the model which will allow the lights to be controlled by SIMH and (potentially) the lock and switches to control SIMH.

### What can I do with this model?
Whatever you want really. As long as you don't try to claim it as your own you're free to use it for whatever you want.  Want to print it out and sell the models?  Fine.  Want to use it as a basis for your own model? Fine, but you need to link back to this model and it has to have the same license.  Want to print it out and drive over it as a disgruntled IBM RS user? What? Why? No!
